    <h3>Term Descriptions:</h3>
    <p><strong>P/E Ratio:</strong> The Price-to-Earnings ratio (P/E ratio) is a crucial valuation measure that compares the current market price of a company's stock to its per-share earnings (EPS). The P/E ratio is calculated by dividing the current stock price by the EPS. This ratio serves multiple purposes:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Valuation Insight:</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>High P/E Ratio:</strong> A high P/E ratio often indicates that the stock is overvalued, suggesting that investors are expecting high future growth rates. It can be a sign that the company has strong growth prospects or that it is currently in a growth phase, attracting investors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Low P/E Ratio:</strong> Conversely, a low P/E ratio might indicate that the stock is undervalued, which could be a buying opportunity. It may also suggest that the company is facing challenges or that it operates in a mature industry with slower growth prospects.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Growth Expectations:</strong> A high P/E ratio could imply that investors expect higher earnings growth in the future compared to companies with a lower P/E ratio. This expectation might be based on factors such as innovative products, market expansion, or a strong competitive position.</li>
            <li><strong>Risk Assessment:</strong> A very high P/E ratio may indicate that the stock is at risk of a significant price correction if the company fails to meet growth expectations. Financial advisors use the P/E ratio to gauge the level of risk associated with investing in the stock.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p><strong>52-Week High/Low:</strong> The 52-Week High/Low is a technical indicator that reflects the highest and lowest prices at which a stock has traded over the past year. This metric provides valuable insights into the stock's historical performance and volatility:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Performance Benchmark:</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>52-Week High:</strong> The highest price in the past year can indicate investor confidence and the stock's ability to reach peak valuations. Stocks trading near their 52-week high may be seen as bullish.</li>
                    <li><strong>52-Week Low:</strong> The lowest price in the past year might indicate periods of investor pessimism or company-specific challenges. Stocks near their 52-week low might present a buying opportunity if the company’s fundamentals are sound.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Volatility Analysis:</strong> The range between the 52-week high and low provides a perspective on the stock’s volatility. A wide range suggests high volatility, which can be associated with higher risk and potential reward. A narrow range may indicate stability but potentially lower returns.</li>
            <li><strong>Trend Identification:</strong> Monitoring the 52-week high/low helps in identifying market trends and sentiment. A stock consistently setting new highs might be in an uptrend, while one hitting new lows could be in a downtrend.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p><strong>Market Cap:</strong> Market capitalization, often referred to as market cap, represents the total market value of a company’s outstanding shares of stock. It is calculated by multiplying the current share price by the total number of outstanding shares. Market cap provides a measure of company size and is critical for several reasons:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Company Size Classification:</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Large-Cap:</strong> Companies with a market cap over $10 billion. They are often industry leaders with stable earnings and dividends, attracting conservative investors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mid-Cap:</strong> Companies with a market cap between $2 billion and $10 billion. They offer a balance between growth potential and stability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Small-Cap:</strong> Companies with a market cap under $2 billion. These companies often have high growth potential but come with higher risk and volatility.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Investment Strategy:</strong> Financial advisors use market cap to align investment strategies with client goals. For instance, large-cap stocks might be recommended for risk-averse investors seeking stable returns, while small-cap stocks might be suitable for those looking for high growth potential.</li>
            <li><strong>Market Influence:</strong> Large-cap companies typically have a significant influence on market indices and overall market movements. Understanding the market cap helps in assessing the company’s impact on the broader market and economic trends.</li>
            <li><strong>Risk and Return:</strong> Smaller companies might offer higher returns due to growth potential, but they also come with higher risk. Large-cap companies, while more stable, might provide more modest returns. Market cap analysis helps in balancing risk and return in a portfolio.</li>
        </ul>
